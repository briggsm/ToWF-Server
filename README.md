# ToWF-Server
Java-based Server to be run on Windows/Mac/Linux machine. Receives audio via audio-in sources &amp; sends it over the LAN.

I use **NetBeans** to write & compile this code. Probably any Java IDE can be made to work, but NetBeans should work to get this code to compile "out of the box".

**Big picture** of entire ToWF system can be seen here: http://briggs-inc.com/blog/towf-doc/

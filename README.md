# ToWF-Server
Java-based Server to be run on Windows/Mac/Linux machine. Receives audio via audio-in sources &amp; sends it over the LAN.

I use **NetBeans** to write & compile this code. Probably any Java IDE can be made to work, but NetBeans should work to get this code to compile "out of the box".

ToWF is made up of these 3 code bases:
- ToWF Server - https://github.com/briggsm/ToWF-Server
- ToWF iOS Client - https://github.com/briggsm/ToWF-iOS
- ToWF Android Client - https://github.com/briggsm/ToWF-Android
